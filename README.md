# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis using Python & SQL

A comprehensive data analysis project on Electric Vehicle (EV) registrations, exploring trends, geographic distributions, vehicle specifications, and clean fuel eligibility — powered by Python and SQL.

----------

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes an EV dataset with key information such as:

-   Vehicle make & model
    
-   Model year
    
-   Electric range
    
-   MSRP (price)
    
-   Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility
    
-   Geographic data (city, county, ZIP, legislative district)
    

The goal is to uncover insights into EV adoption, model popularity, policy impact, and regional distribution.

----------

## 🔧 Technologies Used

-   **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
    
-   **SQLite** (via `sqlite3`)
    
-   **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**
    
-   **SQL** (for complex grouping, filtering, and summarization)
    

----------

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

Each insight is generated using **SQL + Python plotting**:

1.  Top EV Makes & Models
    
2.  Popular Models by Year
    
3.  Most Common EV Types
    
4.  Recent Model Distribution
    
5.  📊 EV Adoption Trend Over Time
    
6.  📍 City-wise EV Distribution
    
7.  📍 EV Density by ZIP Code
    
8.  ⚡ Electric Range Distribution
    
9.  ⚖️ Range vs MSRP Correlation
    
10.  ✅ CAFV Eligibility by County
    
11.  ✅ CAFV Rate by Model Year
    
12.  💰 MSRP Distribution (Box Plot)
    
13.  🥇 Best Value EVs (Range/Price Ratio)
    
14.  🏛️ Top Legislative Districts
    
15.  🌟 New Brands in Latest Years
    

----------



## 📍 Future Improvements

-   Build a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive filters
    
-   Create **heatmaps** based on geographic data
    
-   Add **machine learning models** to predict CAFV eligibility
